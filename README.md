# Red-Blue Graph

This small webapp checks if a provided graph is both bipartite, red-blue colorable, and connected.

A live demo can be found here: .

## Local running

Since there is no back-end logic, the whole webapp can be run locally with ease.

### Requirements

- NodeJS 16

**NOTE**  
It probably works with NodeJS 14, but I haven't tested it.

### Installation

```bash
$ git clone
$ cd red-blue
$ npm i
```

### Running

```bash
$ npm start
```

### Testing

Once the packages are installed it is also possible to run the tests with:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

## Scripts

In the `package.json` file there are other scripts too coming from the default template for a ReactJS project.
Please refer to ReactJS documentation for further information.
